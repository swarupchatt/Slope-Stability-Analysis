This document presents machine learning (ML) models for assessing slope stability that fulfill stringent precision and speed requirements in slope engineering. The dataset has seven unique attributes: Bench Angle (BA), Bench Height (BH), Bench Width (BW), Slope Angle (SA), Joint Angle (JA), Joint Cohesiveness (JC), and Joint Friction Angle (JFA). Initially, we conducted preprocessing on the datasets to render them appropriate for classification and regression analysis. After that, we used a number of standard and ensemble machine learning models, including SVM, K-NN, DT, RF, bagging, and boosting for classification, as well as linear, LARS, lasso, SVR, LassoCV, LassoLarsCV, and Bayes Ridge for regression to predict slope stability analysis. We have also examined the association among the independent components or features in the data. Our findings indicate that ML models have robustness in predicting slope stability, surpassing others in accuracy, even following dimensionality reduction by KPCA.

For reproducibility of the results, please run the above Python code for your convenience.
